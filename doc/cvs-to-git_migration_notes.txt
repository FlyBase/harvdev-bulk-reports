Notes on git migration
Source code from `fb_cvs/FB/scripts/reports/`

Below we have scripts (or script sets) that were not migrated to GitHub because they seem to be unused.

gogenes_pubmed_nc.pl
This script has never been called correctly (see logs for past years).
Even when called correctly, output file has only a header.
So this has not been working and not clear how it's supposed to work.
Since no complaints, it must not be currently used.

report_gene_assessment
The only file written to the "metrics" folder during reporting.
Generated since 2017.
I think this was for Bill but not currently used.

run_core_reports
A wrapper script that write core reports to the bulk_reports/core_reports folder.
Generated since 2017.
Originally intended for Bill and HarvCur but not currently used.
